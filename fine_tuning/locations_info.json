No visitor to Istanbul be it Greta Garbo, Agatha Christie or the King of Spain would leave the city without paying a call. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the Turkish president was a loyal client. Emigrés and civil servants, bohemians and politicians all rubbed shoulders in its wood-paneled dining-room. The common denominator was a sophisticated ambiance, Central & Eastern European delicacies and lashings of ice-cold lemon vodka and some spectacular cocktails. This Istanbul institution with its 98 years tradition is in every detail a legend of a restaurant and bar in istanbul.",
