Result 2: I would like to travel from New York City to 's-Hertogenbosch for 7 days. Give me a trip plan that focuses on museums. And I want to do this as cheaply as possible. How do I do this?

The first thing we'll need to do is figure out what the cheapest way to get from New York to's-Hertogenbosch will be. We have already done this in an earlier example. So we'll skip this part, and start at the point where we know that the cheapest way to get there is via London.

We'll then look through all the museums of's-Hertogenbosch and London that have been added to our database. The easiest way to do that is to look at the list of Dutch museums and the list of London museums. But it's much more convenient to just use our search feature. It will let us search for museums in multiple cities at once, and it will show us which days of the week they're open. We'll search for museums in's-Hertogenbosch and London that are open at least 8 hours on Saturday and Sunday.

We'll also use our search feature to see what's available to see in New York City. This will also give us an indication what the best days to leave are. We'll search for museums in New York City that are open at least 8 hours on Tuesday to Friday, since we want to travel on the weekend
