# deprecated
This folder contains old code that is no longer used. It is kept in the repository purely for documentation purposes.

`./autotrain` contains autotrain commands that are no longer in use. We stopped using Autotrain because we wanted the flexibility to change the underlying code as well.
`./first_tests` and `./second_tests` are old fine tuning code that we used for our initial tests.

## Extra Note:
`./city_names_cleaned.json` and `city_names.json` are smaller versions of the actual data file that originally came out of a xml to json website converter which could not hold the entire file. They are kept here for reference and to act as data for testing if code works.
